  <title>Proof of Reserves Foundation</title>

  <h1>The Proof Of Reserves Foundation</h1>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>To create a transparent home for bar-raising industry members to collaborate on best practices, tooling, language, resources, guidance and voluntary standards surrounding running proof of reserves.</p>
  
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>If a set of private companies attempt to declare that "they do proof of reserves" and they all do it differently, or worse some claim to do it sufficiently to their customers when they actually don't, this adds inefficiency and risk to the entire industry.  This will slow the pace of an entire industry and cost everybody more.  There are valid reasons why custody is necessary, especially for institutions.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td>
Every business shouldn't have to invent proof of reserves.
</td>
<td>
There should be open source technology and service providers ready to help do it right and quickly.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Every business shouldn't have to teach their customers how to validate their balances and review financial statements.
</td>
<td>
There should be crowd-sourced documentation to help this along.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
A single company or organization shouldn't become the defacto record keeper of who does PoR "correctly".
</td>
<td>
An open forum should track progress and short-comings transparently to compete against the outcome of a corruptible or biased institution.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Tactics</h2>
<h3>Community Driven</h3>
Everything about this foundation is community driven.

<h3>Glossary</h3>
The industry needs a glossary, a place where words matter, and translations can be made into other languages, so that industry participants can speak a common language when comparing approaches and technique.  This helps avoid problems when somebody invents their own definitions.

<h4>Real-Time Proof of Reserves</h4>
The idea that reserves are up to date as of the last block and published concurrently.
<h4>Convenient Proof</h4>
When an organization selectively chooses when to do any form of proof of balances, or proof of reserves.  This is better than nothing, however there is risk that it may be gamed.
<h4>Periodic Proof</h4>
When a company adheres to a predictable, or increasing, periodicity of reporting their proof of reserves to stakeholders.
<h4>Proof of Balances</h4>
Also known as self-attested proof-of-reserve, or proof of assets. In this technique the platform discloses their addresses and provides proof (such as a signed message) that they have access to the associated private key.
<h4>Proof of Liabilities</h4>
An area of ongoing research.  There are no known technical ways to proove liabilities encumbering on-chain assets.
<h4>Attestation of Liabilities</h4>
Some form of qualified statement asserting a comprehensive review of the full picture.
<h4>List of Addresses</h4>
A list of public keys containing balances that have not been signed...
<h4>Community Proof of Reserves</h4>
An attempt by external actors to analyze blockchain data in order to reverse-engineer a proof of reserve.
<h4>Negative Balance</h4>
An account with a negative balance can be included to alter the total sum and compromise the validity of associated proof of reserves.  This forces certain techniques.
<h4>Coverage Ratio</h4>
When proof of reserves are coupled with an audit of aggregate off-chain assets & liabilities, this ratio can be calculated to indicate a firm's solvency as well as degree of leverage for firms that choose the additional risks of a fractional reserve model.


<h4>Loan Loss Reserves</h4>
Proof of non-client assets to absorb first loss on loan write downs.

<h4>Counterparty Concentration</h4>
An anonymized ratio that allows lenders to attest to the diversification of their counterparty risk.



<h4>On-Chain Asset Encumberances</h4>
There are many ways in which a digital currency can be unspendable.  Some examples include lost private keys, time-locks, smart-contract features, and multi-sig.

Note that links are not endorsements. For instance, the CoinMarketCap related links, are provided to illustrate why this foundation is needed.  CoinMarketCap is a biased agent slanting the competition, endorsing Binance, Bitfinex unfairly at the expense of Kraken and others.

<h2>Anti-Tactics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Regional Advice - This foundation is global and borderless. 
<li>Profit - If collaboration picks up, a value-for-value model will hopefully keep start and keep a foundation going.
<li>Gate Keep - Manipulate outcomes by creating unecessary hurdles or opaque processes
</ul>
